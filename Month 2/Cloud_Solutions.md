# Cloud Solutions:
  ## Cloud Computing: 
   
   Cloud computing is the delivery of compute services, servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. It provides faster innovation, more flexible resources, and economies of scale.
  The three most in-demand Cloud computing services are:
   - **Software as a Service (SaaS):** 
     SaaS is a software distribution model in which a cloud service provider hosts services. End-users can use these services using the internet. Therefore, there is no need to install any software on the device explicitly. These services are available via web-based. **Example:** Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting etc. 
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** 
     PaaS is a cloud computing model where customers receive hardware and software tools from a third-party supplier over the Internet. **Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift etc. 
   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** 
     IaaS cloud computing service offers pay-as-you-go that provides basic computation, storage, and networking resources on demand. **Example:** DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE) etc.

  ## **Software As A Service** (SAAS):  
   In the cloud industry, Software as a Service, often known as cloud application services, is the most commonly used choice for organisations. SaaS relies on the internet to deliver applications to consumers that are controlled by a third-party vendor. The majority of SaaS apps run immediately through your webpage, thus no downloads or installations are required on the client side.
    
  ### SAAS Delivery:
   - Due to web delivery model there is no need of an IT team to be there for maintenance and handling technical issue, which are generally managed by the vendor itself.
  ### SAAS Advantages:
   SaaS provides numerous advantages to employees and companies which are: 
   - Reducing the time and save money spent on tedious tasks 
   - This frees up plenty of time for technical staff to spend on more pressing matters and issues within the organization.
  ### SaaS Characteristics:
   - Managed from a central location
   - Hosted on a remote server
   - Accessible over the internet
   - Users not responsible for hardware or software updates
  
  ### SaaS Limitations & Concerns:
   - Interoperability:
      A potential issue with SaaS software is that it might not be designed to integrate with all current apps and services. This could mean that enterprises would need to develop their own integration systems or use different SaaS services. 
   - Vendor Lock in:
      Some vendors make it easy for a customer to join their service but difficult for them to leave. This is because the data may not be able to be transferred between different SaaS apps from various suppliers without a lot of cost or work.  
   - Lack of integration support:
       SaaS vendors offer limited support, forcing organizations to invest internal resources in designing and managing integrations. The complexity of integrations can further limit SaaS app or other dependent services can be used.
   - Customization:
       Offers minimal customization capabilities, users limited to specific functionality, performance, and integrations as offered by the vendor 
   - Lack of control:
       Customers need to redefine their data security and governance models to fit the features and functionality of the SaaS service.
   - Performance and downtime:
       Customers depend on vendors to maintain the service’s security and performance, Planned and unplanned maintenance, as vendor manages all the things.
    
  ## **Platform As A Service** (PAAS):
   Platform as a Service is a cloud model where users can access tools to build and run applications. A third-party provider manages the infrastructure and platforms that support the applications.

  ### PAAS Delivery:
  PaaS provides a platform for software creation, delivered via the web, giving developers the freedom to concentrate on building the software without having to worry about other stuff. 

  ### PAAS Advantages:
  - Simple, cost-effective development and deployment of apps
  - Scalable
  - Highly available
  - Developers can customize apps without the headache of maintaining the software
  - Significant reduction in the amount of coding needed
  - Automation of business policy
  - Easy migration to the hybrid model

  ### PAAS Characteristics:
  - Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
  - Provides a variety of services to assist with the development, testing, and deployment of apps
  - Accessible to numerous users via the same development application
  - Integrates web services and databases

  ### PaaS Limitations & Concerns:
  - Data security
      Data residing in third-party, vendor-controlled cloud servers poses security risks and concerns. Security options may be limited as customers may not be able to deploy services with specific hosting policies
  - Integrations
      The complexity of connecting data stored on-premise or in the cloud may limit the apps that can be used with the PaaS offering. Additionally, difficulties may arise when integrating with existing services and infrastructure, particularly when not every component of a legacy IT system has been designed for the cloud.
  - Runtime issues
      Specific framework versions may not be available or perform optimally with the PaaS service. Customers may not be able to develop custom dependencies with the platform.
  - Operational limitation
      PaaS systems are designed to reduce the operational burden on end users by limiting their operational capabilities. However, this lack of control may have negative consequences for an organization's management, provisioning, and operation processes.
      
  ## **Infrastructure As A Service** (IAAS):
   IaaS is made up of highly scalable and automated computational resources. IaaS provides complete self-service access to and management of computers, networking, storage, and other services. Instead of purchasing hardware outright, IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed. 
  ### IAAS Delivery:
  It uses virtualization technologies to supply cloud computing infrastructure (servers, networks, operating systems, storages), often delivered to the company via a dashboard or an API, providing IaaS clients with complete control over the entire infrastructure. 
  IaaS customers can access their servers and storage directly, but everything is handled by a "virtual data centre" on the cloud.
  
  
  ### IAAS Advantages:
  - The most flexible cloud computing model
  - Easy to automate deployment of storage, networking, servers, and processing power
  - Hardware purchases can be based on consumption
  - Clients retain complete control of their infrastructure
  - Resources can be purchased as-needed
  - Highly scalable
  
  ### IAAS Characteristics:
  - Resources are available as a service
  - Cost varies depending on consumption
  - Services are highly scalable
  - Multiple users on a single piece of hardware
  - Organization retain complete control of the infrastructure
  - Dynamic and flexible
  
  ### IaaS Limitations & Concerns:
  - Security
      As the user has complete control over the apps, data, middleware, and OS platform, security threats might still originate from the host or other VMs). Insider threats or system vulnerabilities may allow unauthorized entities to access data communication between the host infrastructure and VMs.
  - Legacy systems operating in the cloud
      Customers may be able to run old apps in the cloud, but the infrastructure may not be designed to provide precise controls to safeguard the apps. Minor improvements to legacy apps may be required before shifting to the cloud, which may result in new security vulnerabilities if not sufficiently tested for security and performance in IaaS systems.
  - Multi-tenant security
      Because hardware resources are dynamically allocated across users as they become available, the vendor must ensure that previous customers' data is not accessed by other customers. Customers must also rely on the vendor to ensure that virtual machines (VMs) are sufficiently segregated within the multitenant cloud architecture.
  - Internal resources and training 
      Additional resources and training may be required for the workforce to learn how to effectively manage the infrastructure. 

## SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS:
  Each cloud model has unique features and functionalities, and understanding the distinctions is critical for your organisation. There is a cloud service for you if you require cloud-based software for storage, a smooth platform that allows you to construct bespoke apps, or complete control over your entire infrastructure without having to physically manage it.

I would prefer using the PAAS model because because of its flexibility and easy to use features. It can be used in different applications and its functionality is wide-ranging.
In PAAS, we only need to take care of the application and its data while the service provider will take care of the other infrastructure and services.
I am thinking of implementing the PAAS model by making an Encrypted Text transfer application that tansfers encrypted message from one user to another user. The main purpose of this application is to transfer secret information from one user to another user without sharing it with the third party.
The key feature of the application will be the encryption and the secrecy of the messages. Multiple cyphering techniques will be used to encrypt the data which include ceaser cypher, vingere cypher or AES/DES ciphering.
