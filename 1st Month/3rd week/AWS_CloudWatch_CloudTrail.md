  *AWS CloudWatch* is a service used for monitoring AWS resources and the applications that run on AWS. CloudWatch enables real time monitoring of AWS resources.
  CloudWatch can be used to collect and track metrics, monitor log files, set alarms and automatically react to changes in AWS resources. It automatically provides metrics for CPU utilisation, latency and request counts.
  Additional metrics can also be monitored such as memory usage, error rates etc.
        
        
 
  ## CloudWatch Metrics:
   These metrics gives user the visibility into the resource utilisation, application performance and operational health. These metrics helps in resolving technical issues and streamlining processes for smoothly running the application.
   Following concepts play an important role in understanding these metrics:
   
  1. **Namespaces:** a container for CloudWatch metrics. Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other so that metrics from different applications are not accidentally aggregated for computing statistics.
  2. **Metrics:** represents a time ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. It can be thought of as a variable that we need to monitor and the data points are the values of the variable over time. Metrics exist only in the region they are created.
  3. **Dimensions:** a name or a value pair that uniquely identifies a metric. You can assign a maximum of 10 dimensions to a metric. Dimensions help you design a structure for your statistics plan.
  4. **Statistics:** are metric data aggregation over time specified by the user. Aggregation are made using the namespace, metric name, dimensions and the data point unit of measure within the time period you specify.
  5. **Percentiles:** as the name suggests, the percentile indicates the relative standing of a value in a dataset. It helps you get a better understanding of the distribution of your metric data. Percentiles are used to detect anomalies.
  6. **Alarms:** used to initiate actions on your behalf. An alarm monitors a metric over a specified interval of time, and performs the assigned actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over time.

  ## CloudWatch Logs:
   CloudWatch Logs helps users to access, monitor and store access log files from aws resources. These logs help in troubleshooting systems and applications. CloudWatch logs are a managed service which can be provisioned with no extra purchases from within your AWS accounts. They are easy to work with from the AWS console or the AWS CLI. They have deep integration with AWS services. They are able to trigger alerts based on certain logs occurring in the logs.
   
   
   Foro collecting logs, AWS offers a new unified CloudWatch agent and an older CloudWatch Logs agent. AWS recommends using the unified CloudWatch agent. When you install the agent on a EC2 instance, it automatically creates a log group as part of the process. You can also create a log group directly from the AWS console. After the CloudWatch Logs agent begins publishing log data to Amazon CloudWatch, users can begin searching and filtering data based on metric filtering.
   
   ## CloudWatch Events:
   CloudWatch Events allows users to consume a near real time stream of events as changes to their AWS environment takes place. These event changes can subsequently trigger notifications or other actions.
   The main components of CloudWatch events are:
   - **Events:** generated in four ways. It is represented by small blobs of JSON. They can arise from within AWS when a resource changes it’s state. They can arise when events are generated by API calls and console sign-ins that are delivered to Amazon CloudWatch Events via CloudTrail. Another way is when your own code can generate application-level events and publish them to Amazon CloudWatch Events for processing. The last way is that they can be issued on a scheduled basis, with options for periodic or Cron-style scheduling.
   - **Rules:** match incoming events and route them to one or more targets or processing. Rules do not have any order for processing, all the rules matching for a particular event will be processed.
   - **Targets:** process events and are specified within the rules. There are four initial target types: built-in, Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, and SNS topics. A single rule can specify multiple targets.

# AWS CloudTrail:
  AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps enabling governance, compliance, operational and risk auditing of AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.
  
  - It’s enabled when the account is created
  - When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event.
  - Entries can be viewed in Event History(for 90 days)
  - Event logs can be aggregated across accounts.

This screenshot of the Cloudtrail events area shows a list of events, filtered by a specific username.

  ## Use Cases for AWS CloudTrail:
  - Troubleshooting: Cloudtrail can be used to determine the cause of certain operational issues. For example, Cloudtrail allows you to check the event history to determine which resources were recently created, deleted or modified as well as who made these changes. 
  - Anomaly Detection: Cloudtrail Insights allows you to detect spikes or unusual activity and set alerts.
  - Security, compliance and risk auditing: Cloudtrail allows you to have an event history should you need to go back and check past events. For example, if it is suspected that a user account was breached, Cloudtrail can be used to review all activities performed by that user. Cloudtrail can also be used in conjunction with other services to trigger a an action in response to certain events. For example, it could detect when a user is trying to modify a security group or perform other actions not allowed by your organization and trigger a response.

# Brief summary of CloudWatch VS CloudTrail:
  Cloudwatch allows you to monitor how your AWS resources are doing while Cloudtrail allows you to monitor who did what within your AWS environment. In general, use cases that lean towards visualizing and using resource metrics, analyzing logs and triggering alarms tend to fit well with Cloudwatch whereas Cloudtrail helps with logging activity history, security and compliance. However, it’s important to keep in mind that practically speaking, in most cases both of these services are used in conjunction with each other to get greater visibility into the overall AWS environment.
