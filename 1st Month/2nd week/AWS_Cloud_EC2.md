# **AWS Cloud EC2**
## What is EC2:
   EC2 refers to **Elastic Cloud Compute**. EC2 is a *virtual server* in the AWS Cloud. It makes it easier for us to scale up and down easyily, as a result we can access the resource on demand.
   No upfront cost or payment is required as you only pay for what you use. It is also very secure.
  
## Getting Started with EC2:
   We can easily get started with EC2 in just 3 easy and simple steps, that are:
    1. Launch: Select a template with basicconfigurations (operating system, application server, or applications), decide the instance type, hardware configuration of your instance and specify the security settings to control the traffic in and out of your instance
    2. Connect: Programs and applications have multiple connection methods to exchange data. Users can connect and access the computer desktop by logging.
    3. Use: Once connected you can easily execute commands to install software, add storage, copy, and organize files, and much more.

## AWS Cloud EC2 Instance Types:
   There are many different instances of EC2 depending upon the needs(compute, memory, or storage). selecting an instance type, consider the needs.    
### General Purpose Instance:  
   General Purpose Instances are best when there is a balance between the resources. It fits many purposes, such as application servers, gaming servers, backend servers for companies, and small and medium databases.
### Compute Optimized Instances:
   These are best use if high compute is capacity is required. This type is ideal for high-performance and compute-intensive needs.
### Memory Optimized Instances:
   These can deliver dataset workloads fast. The Memory Optimized Instances are best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.
### Accelerated Computing Instances:
   This type use hardware accelerators for boosting the data processing. Thses are best for graphics applications and streaming.
### Storage Optimized Instances:
   This type is best when you have large datasets on local storage. These are designed to deliver many inputs as fast as possible.

## AWS Cloud EC2 Scaling:
   Scaling is only using the resources that you need, with the flexibility to grow freely. Designing a scalable achitecture allow you to only pay for the resources that you need at any given time.
   There are two approaches for scaling:
   - Dynamic scaling: responds to changing demand
   - Predictive scaling: schedules the number of instances based on a predicted demand
    
   Thses both approaches can be combined together to scale faster.
    
### Auto-Scaling:
   EC2 Auto Scaling can be added as a buffer on top of your instances. It can add new instances to the application when necessary and terminate them when no longer needed automatically.
   You can set up a group of instances. Here you can set minimum capacity, the desired number, and the maximum capacity of instances that will always be running.
